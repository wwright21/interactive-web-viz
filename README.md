<b>Bellybutton Biodiversity Web Visualization</b>

This project built an interactive, web-based dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (source: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). This study catalogs the microbes that colonize the human navels of 153 test subjects.

The dashboard visualizes the findings through several charts which are programmed to update with each selection input from the user.
